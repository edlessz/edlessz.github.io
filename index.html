            <u>Experience</u>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IT & Software Development Intern</b> (Jun. 2023 - Present): As an intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://naii.com/">North Atlantic Industries</a>, I designed and developed web applications for internal use. Using Angular, C#, and SQL databases, I created user-friendly solutions that automated operations, provided organizatoin, and improved efficiency. This experience at North Atlantic Industries has significantly enhanced my technical skills with real-world problems, and reinforced my commitment to driving innovation in the field of software development. It also provided a great opportunity to learn how to collaborate on a project.</li>
                <li><b>Freelance Development</b> (Mar. 2021 - Present): I took up managing different software projects for businesses. This included VB.NET order systems interacting with SQL servers, as well as WordPress sites powered with PHP. This unique experience has provided me with insight into how different businesses manage their digital presence, and challanges to adapt to different technologies and workflows. Working on these projects also tested my independent problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li><b>Student Mentor</b> (Aug. 2019 - Present): At <a href="https://kidoyo.com/" target="_blank">KidOYO</a>, I had the privilege of teaching aspiring coders from 8 to 18 all about the fundementals of computer programming. Languages taught ranged from making simple games in block-based coding, to making simple games in Python and JavaScript. Having to explain concepts such as these to kids helped me understand the concepts myself more, often having to break them down into the smallest of parts. The experience also provided me with collaboration skills as I sometimes taught classes with other people.</li>

            <u>Personal Projects</u>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="infinisweeper/" target="_blank"><b>Infinisweeper</b></a> (HTML5 Game): Unleash your strategic genius and challenge your brain in an addicting, limitless mine-clearing experience. Explore endless grids, adapt to ever-changing challenges, and compete on global leaderboards. Challenge your friends and compete for the highest score.<br/>Infinisweeper started when I realized one day that I had no idea how to play Minesweeper. I always used to play it as a kid, but I had no idea what I really was doing. I learned it and I quickly thought of it as the perfect game. It could be played forever, over and over again. But the only problem was, every time you won a game, you had to start all over again. Infinisweeper is the solution to the one and only flaw in Minesweeper.</li>
                <li><a href="array-map-creator/" target="_blank"><b>Array Map Creator</b></a> (Web app): A simple pixel art program that can export your art into two dimensional arrays, perfect for simple game development.<br />When I was just starting to learn Python and Javascript at the beginning of middle school, I often made small 2D games using two-dimensional arrays to represent the game worlds. However, as the game worlds got bigger and bigger, it got harder to visualize the entire world just by looking at a bunch of numbers. It was also more difficult to edit the world, having to replace numbers one at a time. This web app serves as an easy-to-use solution to that problem.</li>
                <li><a href="stick-together/" target="_blank"><b>Stick Together</b></a> (HTML5 Game): Take on an endless runner adventure with a powerful grappling hook. Swing through challenging terrain, collect coins, and collect every item in the shop.<br />This game was made in 1 week for a small game jam. The theme was "stick together". The intention was for the games to be co-op experiences, but I took a spin on the theme and made a game where you have to stick to things.</li>

            <u>Other Hobbies</u>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Listening to music:</b> I am a huge fanatic for different kinds of music spanning many genres. My love for music only grew bigger when I found a way to mix it with my love for math. I collect vinyl records and catalogue them in spreadsheets, and have been recording everything I have listened to since 2019 on <a target="_blank" href="https://last.fm/user/edscamera">last.fm</a>. <span id="lastfm"></span></li>
                <li><b>Playing music:</b> I grew up playing and still play the cello. I recently picked up the bass guitar as well.</li>
