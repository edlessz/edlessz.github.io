            <h1 marker="AboutMe">Hey there!</h1>
            <p>I'm Ed, a Computer Science major currently in my freshman year at Stony Brook University. I'm passionate about technology and all things code-related. I love tackling challenging problems and finding creative solutions.</p>
            <p>Ever since I could remember, I've always been fascinated by the world of programming and software development. My love of math in high school only drew me closer to the field. I've been making video games for my own enjoyment ever since I was 10 years old. Whether it's building web applications or developing games, I'm always eager to learn more.</p>
            <p>My future goal is to become a proficient software developer, working on exciting projects that make a real impact on daily lives.</p>
            <p>Some of my other hobbies and interests include listening to and collecting music, playing the cello, and photography.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>As an intern at North Atlantic Industries, I designed and developed web applications for internal use. Using Angular, C#, and SQL databases, I created user-friendly solutions that automated operations, provided organizatoin, and improved efficiency.

                <p>I took up managing different software projects for businesses. This included VB.NET order systems interacting with SQL servers, as well as WordPress sites powered with PHP. This unique experience has provided me with insight into how different businesses manage their digital presence, and challanges to adapt to different technologies and workflows. Working on these projects also tested my independence, and what I am to do when there is no one to help me but the internet.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>At KidOYO, I had the privilege of teaching aspiring coders from 8 to 18 all about the fundementals of computer programming. Languages taught ranged from making simple games in block-based coding, to making simple games in Python and JavaScript. Having to explain concepts such as these to kids helped me understand the concepts myself more, often having to break them down into the smallest of parts. The experience also provided me with collaboration skills as I sometimes taught classes with other people.</p>
